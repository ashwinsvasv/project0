	<h2>The Story</h2>
	<p>I started quizzing at the age of 9 when I was called by my teachers for selections for the inter-school competitions conducted between our group of schools in the city. I ended up getting selected and going for the cluster quiz and answering a picture question with Sania Mirza with just one block showing her earring, thus bagging the third position for our school.
	<br></br>
	I also participated in the inter-house quiz in 6<sup>th</sup> standard when my brother defeated me as he was in 12<sup>th</sup> standard from another house. Once I changed schools in 7<sup>th</sup> standard, I joined a quiz club in an attempt to improve my quizzing pursuits. I could not do anything except for answer questions which the coordinator asked. In 10<sup>th</sup> standard my passion for quizzing was revived when one of my seniors selected me for the inter-house quiz which was about Indian Mythology and we defeated all by a huge margin.
	In 11<sup>th</sup> standard, I participated in quite a few quizzes and gained fame for being a quizzer in my school as I won the Murugappa Madras Quiz which was famous in the city. In 12<sup>th</sup> standard, I was selected to be the quiz club head of my school and was in-charge of selecting students to represent the school in quizzes.</p>
