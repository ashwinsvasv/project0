# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
"# project0" #The project0 website, which I have built with four pages - Home, Quizzing, Music and Leadership consists of my personal interests.
The index.html file contains a timeline of mine. The .html file contains minimal styling. website.css contains most of the styling for the project.
quizzing.html contains my quizzing expereinces in school and how I gained a lot of knowledge and experience along with a picture of mine and a list of quizzes I won and my quizmates. 
music.html contains one of my performances at school-level (carnatic music) and also my list of favourite ragas (ragas are similar to scales in western music)
leadership.html contains my tryst with how I was given opportunities to lead people and how I used those opportunities well.  and a couple of team pictures of me in organising committees.
