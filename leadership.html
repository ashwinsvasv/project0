	<h2>The Journey so far</h2>
	<p>My tryst with leadership has come far now from my 2<sup>nd</sup> standard where I was appointed as the class leader by my class teacher due to my ability to score amazing marks with ease. In 5<sup>rd</sup> standard, again I was elected class leader by the entire class with an exception of three classmates who voted for the other contestant. Both of us became best friends in the following couple of years.
	<br></br>In 6<sup>th</sup> standard, I wasn't the class leader. However, as the leader was too dominating, the class took my side and once we boycotted the leader when he complained about us to the teacher saying we were blackmailing him and threatening him that he was misusing his power. 
	<br></br>In 9<sup>th</sup> standard, I was again made the class leader and this time, things were different. It was difficult to manage a bunch of pesky teenageers than middle school kids. I believe I did a pretty good job along with Trisha.
	<br></br> Then in 10<sup>th</sup> standard, I was made class leader along with Trisha for the first half of the year. It was difficult to handle the class at that time because it was shattered in pieces. 
	<br></br>In 11<sup>th</sup> standard, I learnt what being a leader really is from my seniors and teachers. I saw how instructions were given clearly and how suggestions were taken from our teachers. Our seniors taught us that the leader must work for others to follow. 
	<br></br>One experience I will remember throughout my life is when I was given a chance to lead the Patriotic Song team for the house. I listened to many songs and selected a few amongst them for us to sing. However, as we started practising late, I understood that the songs didn't sync with the instruments and violin. As a smart person, I should have either changed the songs or the instruments. However, a part of my mind said that this can be made to work for sure. I spent sleepless nights wondering how to get the tuning right and to make the performance presentable. When I realised it wasn't possible to win with this combination, it was already late.
	We performed poorly and ended up placing last of the four. This will be one of the biggest takeaways from this journey which taught me not to panic in dire situations and to not resist change when things are not working out properly. 
	<br></br>I got a chance to regain my confidence in September. I joined the school's quizzing event's organising committee and started coordinating things among the team. It was a new experience where I could not boss over anyone but had to sweet talk so that things were done properly and on time. Fortunately, we were a bunch of motivated and hardworking individuals. So, getting work done was a pleasure than a chore. Doing work to inspire was more difficult.
	<br></br>At the end of 11<sup>th</sup>, I was made the Quiz Club Head along with Megs and there was no turning back. The year started with Astra for which I was the department head of Research and Development. Leading the time was not a big deal with the experience I had in the past along with my seniors' training. Then, we had patriotic song for which my strategy changed drastically. I was delegating more work and taking everyone's opinion before deciding. The result was a success. The year ended with the school's inter-school quiz for which
	as a head, I had to only instruct my capable juniors who took the task in their own hands and completed them.</p>
